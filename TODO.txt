Trigger neighbor chunk to reload if it is exposed

Save light levels, so we can detect changes (and determine whether chunk border values have been modified)
If block is removed, propagate existing light
If block is added, start light propagation from scratch
If light_fill touches chunk edge, reload neighbor chunk
Ensure block maps are updated on load.
